# Server Pack Locator

This mod acts as a plugin to [FancyModLoader](https://github.com/neoforged/FancyModLoader) that allows loading
mods and configuration files from the Minecraft server before starting the actual game.
This will keep a pack automatically up to date, without using a launcher, and allows for mods to be kept private
by authenticating players before mods can be downloaded.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you install this mod on your client, you fully trust the server you are connecting to.
> The server you set in the configuration file of this mod will be able to send you malicious software.

## Client-Side Configuration

The configuration file is expected to be found at `spl/config.toml` relative to your game directory.
